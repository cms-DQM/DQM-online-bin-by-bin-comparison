Baseline, pull request, and overlay links point to the DQM GUI.
Some changes in DQM files might not be clearly displayed in the DQM GUI, like presence/absence of efficiency flag or changed QT result when the ME that was tested didn't change.
For this reason, you can use raw baseline and raw pull request links to inspect ROOT files without interpreting them as DQM ROOT file.
