I want to compare at least 20 events per LS.

----------

Notes for the user:
  The 1st line is for base release.
  The 2nd line is for comp release.
  The 3rd line is for your minimum events per LS to compare.

In format:
  [playback_blablabla] [run number] [run key] [express GlobalTag] [HLT GlobalTag]

Where [playback_blablabla] is copied from `readlink -f current_playback` or a release name in /dqmdata/dqm_cmssw/

It should have the pattern:
  playback_[mmdd]_[CMSSW_14_0_4_UL_patch1_pre2]_[44675_44621]

IMPORTANT:
  To match the pattern please do not put an '_' into the term [mmdd]. So if the copied one has such '_' in [mmdd_myBlablabla], please change the writing to [mmddAndMyBlablabla] and proceed.
